These can include financial loss, damage to the charity\u2019s reputation, and legal action.\n\nFinancial loss is a major concern for charities.

This can lead to a loss of revenue for the charity, which can be difficult to recover.\n\nDamage to the charity\u2019s reputation is another potential consequence of hacking. If donors or the public learn that a charity has been hacked, they may be less likely to donate in the future. This can lead to a decline in donations, which can be difficult to recover.\n\nLegal action is also a potential consequence of hacking a charity.
